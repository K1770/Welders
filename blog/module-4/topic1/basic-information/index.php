                <span class="p-first-words-bold">Particulate fume.</span> More than 90 % of the particulate fume arises from vaporisation of the consumable electrode, wire or rod as material is transferred across the arc or flame. The range of welding particles size is shown in relation to the more familiar types of dust and fume. The respirable fraction of particles (especially less than 3μm) are potentially the more harmful as they can penetrate to the innermost parts of the lung.

                <span class="p-first-words-bold">1.Irritation of the respiratory tract. </span> Fine particles can cause dryness of the throat, tickling, coughing and if the concentration is particularly high, tightness of the chest and difficulty in breathing.

                <span class="p-first-words-bold">2. Metal fume fever. </span> Breathing in metal oxides such as zinc and copper can lead to an acute flu-like illness called “metal fume fever”. It most commonly occurs when welding galvanised steel; symptoms usually begin several hours after exposure with a thirst, cough, headache, sweat, pain in the limbs and fever. Complete recovery usually occurs within 1 to 2 days of removal from the exposure, without any lasting effects.

              <div class="p-main">
                <span class="p-first-words-bold">3. Longer term effects. </span> The continued inhalation of welding fume over long periods of time can lead to the deposition of iron particles in the lung, giving rise to a benign condition called siderosis. There is evidence that welders have a slightly greater risk of developing lung cancer than the general population. In certain welding situations, there is potential for the fume to contain certain forms of chromium and/or nickel compounds - substances which have been associated with lung cancer in processes other than welding. As yet, no direct link has been clearly established. Nevertheless, as a sensible precaution and to minimise the risk, special attention should be paid to controlling fumes which may contain them.

If the metal contains a surface coating, there will also be a potential risk from any toxic substances generated by thermal degradation of the coating.

                <span class="p-first-words-bold">1. Irritation of the respiratory tract. </span> Ozone can cause delayed irritation of the respiratory tract which may progress to bronchitis and occasionally pneumonia. Nitrogen oxides can cause a dry irritating cough and chest tightness. Symptoms usually occur after a delay of 4 to 8 hours. In severe cases, death can occur from pulmonary oedema (fluid on the lungs) or pneumonia.

                <span class="p-first-words-bold">2. Asphyxiation. </span> There may be a risk of asphyxiation due to replacement of air with gases produced when welding in a workshop or area with inadequate ventilation. Special precautions are needed when welding in confined spaces where there is the risk of the build up of inert shielding gases. Carbon monoxide, formed as a result of incomplete combustion of fuel gases, can also cause asphyxiation by replacing the oxygen in the blood.

                <span class="p-first-words-bold">Establishing safe levels of fume in the workplace.</span> The COSHH Regulations* require that exposure is controlled below specific limits. The limits, known as occupational exposure limits, are detailed in EH 40 which is revised periodically. The majority of limits listed are for single substances. Only a few relate to substances which are complex mixtures; welding fume is one of these. It has an occupational exposure limit but account must also be taken of the exposure limits of the individual constituents. So, in considering what would be safe exposure levels to welding fume, not only should exposure be controlled to within the welding fume limit but also the individual components must be controlled to within their own limits. The assessment of exposure to fume from welding processes is covered in EH 54.

Exposure must be reduced as far as is reasonably practicable and at least below any MEL. An OES is the concentration of an airborne substance, for which (according to current information) there is no evidence that it is likely to cause harm to a persons health , even if they are exposed day after day. Control is thought to be adequate if exposure is reduced to or below the standard.</span>
